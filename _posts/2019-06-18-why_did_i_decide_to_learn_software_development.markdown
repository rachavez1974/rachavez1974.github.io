I decided to become a software engineer at a young age when my foster Dad gave me my first computer.  That computer was a Texas Instrument desktop that I used save my files using cassette tapes, lol.  That computer also talked with a language word limit of around 250 words, but one could make sentences with these words. It actually sounded like Stephen Hawkin.  So my first high level computer language I learned was basic, then I learned Pascal.  When I was in college I also extensively learned c++, and Java.  Since I was 6 years old I knew I wanted to be a computer scientist, and I started to learn math and logic.  As I was growing up I enjoyed solving word problems, and that's why I love solving physical problems using computer.
