<p>My dream has always been to become a software developer because I love building things, and I love logic.  When I was young, I got my computer science degree, but I never did anything with it because I decided to open my own business.  I worked on my own restaurant for a long time, but sold it and I'm ready for next adventure as full stack software engineer.</p>
